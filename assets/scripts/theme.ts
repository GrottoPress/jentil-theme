| About Typescript
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Typescript is a statically-typed language developed by Microsoft,
| as a superset of JavaScript. This means you can go ahead and paste
| regular JS code here, and they should work OK.
|
| Typescript adds classical object oriented features on top of JS, eg:
| classes, abstract classes, interfaces and the like.
|
| It compiles to plain JavaScript. You could write your code using the
| latest JS features (think ES6), and it should compile down to a more
| compatible version of JS.
|
| Try it; you would love it!
