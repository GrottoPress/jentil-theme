|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Declaration files
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| A declaration is how you tell the Typescript compiler that you are going
| to use an object, method, variable etc. not defined/imported in the
| current module/file.
|
| They are sort of like C/C++ header files, and consists only of member
| signatures.
|
| See `assets/scripts/global.d.ts` in Jentil for examples.
|
| Add `/// <reference path="./global.d.ts" />` in any new `.ts` file, to use
| the declarations here in that file.
